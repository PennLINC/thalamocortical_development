Welcome to the human atlas of topographically-specific thalamocortical structural connections! This population-level tractography atlas is comprised of ipsilateral connections between the thalamus and specific cortical regions defined by the HCP-MMP (Glasser360) atlas. 

This tractography atlas can be used with dsi-studio's automated tractography ("autotrack") approach as a prior in order to identify the same connections in individual participants' data. To do this, both the “ICBM152_adult.tt.gz” (autotrack tracts) and “ICBM152_adult.tt.gz.txt” (tract name list) files are required and must be located in the location expected by the dsi-studio software.

* On a Mac, this location is dsi_studio/dsi_studio.app/Contents/MacOs/atlas/ICBM152_adult. The files must retain the names used here.

* In a container, this location is /opt/dsi-studio/atlas/ICBM152_adult. To use these files with a dsi-studio container, bind a local directory containing the usual contents of atlas/ICBM152_adult (i.e., those provided with the software) PLUS these thalamus-specific .tt.gz and .tt.gz.txt files to the container directory (e.g., -B /cbica/projects/thalamocortical_development/software/thalamocortical_autotrack_template/dsi-studio/atlas/ICBM152_adult/:/opt/dsi-studio/atlas/ICBM152_adult). Or, bind the individual thalamus-specific .tt.gz and .tt.gz.txt files to their corresponding original files in /opt/dsi-studio/atlas/ICBM152_adult.

** It is highly recommended that you use this thalamocortical tractography atlas with the same autotrack parameters validated here for participant-specific data. These parameters include –otsu_threshold=0.5, –smoothing=1, –tolerance=10, –tip_iteration=0, –track_voxel_ratio=4, –check_ending=0, and (for command line usage) –yield_rate=0.0000001. Modifying the tolerance parameter may be reasonable to delineate even stricter trajectory-based pathways (lower the tolerance) or to allow for potential greater individual-specific differences in anatomy to emerge (increase the threshold).
