The perm.sphere.p.R script included in this github repo directory was used for parcel-based spatial permutation (spin) testing in this work to generate p-values for the spatial correlation between two cortical surface maps. This code was developed and made publicly available by František Váša at https://github.com/frantisekvasa/rotate_parcellation/blob/master/R/perm.sphere.p.R. The script is included in this thalamocortical_development repo solely to facilitate reproducibility and code implementation efforts, but **all credit to the original author and team**. You can read more about the rotate_parcellation algorithms at https://github.com/frantisekvasa/rotate_parcellation/tree/master. If using the rotate_parcellation scripts, please cite:
